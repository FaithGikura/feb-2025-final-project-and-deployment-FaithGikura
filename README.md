# Tech Store Website
#Overview
The Tech Store Website is a fully responsive front-end project developed to simulate an online technology products store.
It provides a clean user interface for product presentation and a functional contact form incorporating client-side validation.

This project demonstrates skills in structuring websites with semantic HTML, styling with CSS Grid and Flexbox, and adding interactivity with JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
HTML5 – for structuring the content.

CSS3 – for layout, design, and responsiveness.

JavaScript – for client-side form validation and user interaction.

## Features
Responsive layout compatible with mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Contact form with real-time validation:

Validation checks for name, email, and message fields.

Displays appropriate error messages when fields are invalid.

Organized file structure to enhance maintainability and scalability.
